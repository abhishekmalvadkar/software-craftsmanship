1. Developers can also give some buisness ideas to product owner or buisness analyst
2. It is very important that developer should understand the Domain properly and he should also do the same thing that product owner or BA do
3. As a developer you should study your domain so you can also come up with good ideas
4. Know about your domain from YouTube, books and blogs etc....
5. You should be responsible for end user and think about them and the consequences and risk
6. Our code has huge impact on outside world , if you see around you there is lots of our code , and we can think about to make world better or worse because your code is having huge impact on world , it's your responsibility
7. I am frustrated by watching that agile means only proecss based methodology means scrum but no one is following that you should also follow technical methodology of agile which is nothing but extreme programming or software Craftsmanship by keeping in mind that we should not deliver only working software but we should deliver well crafted software or code
8. Agile menifesto says : we should deliver working software
9. But software Craftsmanship menifesto says which is built on top of agile menifesto by seeing that people are only following process based methodology like scrum but not technical methodology like extreme Programming : we should deliver well crafted software or code
10. On that note I am run out of my time
