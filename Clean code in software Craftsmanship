1. Software Craftsmanship menifesto is actually well written document you can find it on internet , and the very first point it talk about that as a developer we should not create only working software but we should create well crafted software.
2. As a developer you should not only focus on achieving requirement ot jira ticket but you should also focus on clean code and quality of the code also.
3. You should deliver well crafted code 
4. To paraphrase this or as a points that
- No jugad
- No just putting things together in order to just work
- doing things in well crafted way
- No commented code 
- Properly naming variable
- properly structured code that looks good
- Having small functions
- Having small classes
- Having proper error handling in place
- readable code is most important thing
5. Are you making clean git commits or not ? That's also important
- Most of time we see in commit such files that should not be there like binary files , .class files , because it does not have proper gitignore file.
- and does not have read me file which is not good
6. When we are talking about clean code so we can expand it at outside of code as well like below
- good clean repo
- clean commits
- you can use good BDD practice to describe domain requirement in clean manner
7. Clean code is an attitude
8. For reference you can do like below
- TDD
- continues Refactoring
- clean code book by uncle Bob
- Use Boyse scout rule in coding
- implementation patterns book by Kent back
- java by comparison book
- search clean code katas and practice it
